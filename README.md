## Coding Bootcamp Module 3 Password Generator

- My motivation for building this web application was to make it easier for users to find passwords!
- I built this application to rectify the hardships of thinking of a password.
- This can help users save time thinking of their own passwords and even give them a more secure password that is more unique!
- So far I have learned that even the smallest projects can impact and improve someones life significantly by making tasks easier that they would otherwise maybe stress over!
